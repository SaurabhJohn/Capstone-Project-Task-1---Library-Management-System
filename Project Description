 Library Management System (SQL Project)

This project is a SQL-based Library Management System designed to efficiently manage a library's core operations, including book inventories, member information, and borrowing transactions. It involves three key relational tables: Books, Members, and BorrowingRecords, with proper foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.

Features:

    1) Database Design: Structured schema with well-defined relations between books, members, and borrow records.

    2) Sample Data: Populated tables with sample entries to simulate a working library environment.

    3) Information Retrieval:

        a) List of books borrowed by a specific member.

        b) Identify members with overdue books.

        c) Genre-wise book availability.

        d) Most borrowed books and cross-genre borrowing activity.

    4) Reporting & Analytics:

        a) Monthly borrowing statistics.

        b) Top active members.

        c) Frequently borrowed authors.

        d) Members who have never borrowed a book.
