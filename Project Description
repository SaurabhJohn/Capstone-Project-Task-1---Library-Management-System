The Library Management System is a SQL-based project aimed at managing the operations of a library efficiently. It includes three core tables: Books, Members, and BorrowingRecords, each designed to handle essential data related to book inventory, member details, and borrowing transactions. The system ensures data consistency through appropriate foreign key relationships.
Key Objectives:

    1) Design and creation of normalized database tables.
    2) Insertion of sample data to simulate real-world usage.
    3) Retrieval of meaningful information using SQL queries.
    4) Generation of analytical reports based on borrowing trends and member activity.

This project covers a wide range of SQL functionalities such as data definition, data manipulation, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and reporting, providing a comprehensive overview of relational database management in a library setting.
